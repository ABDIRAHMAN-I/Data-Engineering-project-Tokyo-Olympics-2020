- What is the key pain point? 

The Head of Marketing wants to analyze the performance of different countries in the 2021 Olympics to decide on which countries' teams would be best to target for marketing campaigns in future sports events.

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the performance of various countries in the 2021 Olympics. The dashboard should include:

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which countries to focus on for future marketing campaigns related to sports events.

## User story 

As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a dashboard that analyzes the performance data of countries in the 2021 Olympics.

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top-performing countries based on metrics like total medal count and event-specific success.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which countries' teams are right to target for future marketing campaigns, and therefore maximize the effectiveness of each marketing campaign.
